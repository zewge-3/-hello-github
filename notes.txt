There are my first Github notes
Learning branches is fun
Accessing Github locally is very cool and smart way.


## Create a new branch called "feature-branch"
git branch feature-branch

## Switch to your new branch
git checkout feature-branch

## Shortcut to create and switch in one step:
git checkout -b feature-branch
